## Features

- **Zero-shot Classification**: Uses [joeddav/xlm-roberta-large-xnli](https://huggingface.co/joeddav/xlm-roberta-large-xnli) for intent detection.
- **Dialogue Generation**: Utilizes the [thu-coai/CDial-GPT2_LCCC-base](https://huggingface.co/thu-coai/CDial-GPT2_LCCC-base) model for generating dialogue responses.
- **Fitness Suggestions**: Provides workout recommendations based on the userâ€™s target muscle group and fitness goals (e.g., muscle gain or fat loss).
- **Fitness Database Lookup**: Retrieves top-rated exercise suggestions from the fitness database to offer optimized workout plans for different muscle groups.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Builds the API server and handles requests.
- **pymysql**: Connects to and queries the MySQL database.
- **transformers**: Used for NLP models, including intent classification and dialogue generation.
- **pandas**: Data processing library used for data management and formatting (only in specific data processing scenarios).
- Install required packages:
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    

## Dataset

The application utilizes a fitness dataset from [Gym Exercise Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niharika41298/gym-exercise-data), containing over 2,500 workout suggestions, including exercise names, descriptions, targeted muscle groups, required equipment, etc.

## Models

- **Intent Classification Model**: joeddav/xlm-roberta-large-xnli - an NLP model used for zero-shot classification.
- **Dialogue Generation Model**: [thu-coai/CDial-GPT2_LCCC-base](https://huggingface.co/thu-coai/CDial-GPT2_LCCC-base) - a model used to generate dialogue responses.

## Database Setup

### Creating the Database

- Open a new SQL tab in MySQL Workbench and enter the following SQL command to create the database:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE gym_bot_db;
    ```
    
- Select the database:
    
    ```sql
    USE gym_bot_db;
    ```
    
- Create the exercise data table: Based on the Gym Exercise Dataset, create the `exercises` table to store exercise data with the following fields:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE exercises (
        ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        Title VARCHAR(255),
        Description TEXT,
        Type VARCHAR(50),
        BodyPart VARCHAR(50),
        Equipment VARCHAR(50),
        Level VARCHAR(20),
        Rating DECIMAL(3, 1),
        RatingDesc VARCHAR(255)
    );
    ```
    
- Import data using Python: Use `importData.py` for data cleaning and importing.
    
    ```bash
    python importData.py
    ```
    
- Verify data import success:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM exercises;
    ```
    

## Configuration

- Update the database connection settings in `app.py` to connect to a local or remote database correctly. Start the Flask application:
    
    ```bash
    python app.py 
    ```
    
- Open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/) to interact with TrainGymPT through the interface.
